# Bayesian generalized biclustering analysis via adaptive structured shrinkage (Biostatistics, 2020)
Ziyi Li, Changgee Chang, Suprateek Kundu & Qi Long

## Abstract 
We propose a novel Bayesian biclustering method that can handle multiple data types including Gaussian, Binomial, and Negative Binomial. In addition, our method uses a Bayesian adaptive structured shrinkage prior that enables feature selection guided by existing biological information.

## Code Description
- ADdata_300.rda contains a sample of real data.
- DWL.R contains the supporting functions that are needed for GBC_EM.R. 
- GBC_EM.R contains the main function for GBC. 
- analysis_master.R contains the example code for the model implementation and model selection. 
- bic_buning.R contains the BIC function used in the model selection procedure.
